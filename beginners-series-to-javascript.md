Practical examples of switch usage and other conditional patterns that keep code tidy.

## Video 29 — Creating arrays
Covers array creation and basic indexing, explaining when arrays are the right structure for ordered data.

## Video 30 — Demo — Creating arrays
Shows how to build arrays, access elements, and the basics of mutating array contents.

## Video 31 — Populating arrays
Explains different ways to add items to arrays and when to use methods like push, unshift, or direct assignment.
